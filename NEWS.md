# DCVtestkit 0.0.1.9000 (development version)

## TODO

* Regarding the spurious cases of the dilution curves: flag curves every time they have a PRA value close to 0.8?
* Flag curves with negative correlation close to 1

# DCVtestkit 0.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Aim to create a tag version of this
