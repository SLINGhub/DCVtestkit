# DCVtestkit (Dilution Curve Validation Testkit)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

R package used to validate if a dilution curve is linear or not.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JauntyJJS/DCVtestkit")
```
## How it works

We try to categorise dilution curves based on the results of three parameters  

 * Correlation Coefficient ($R$) 
 * Mandel's Fitting Test  
 * Percent Residual Accuracy ($PRA$)  

Correlation Coefficient ($R$) can be found in this [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00769-002-0487-6).
Equation ($1$) is used.

Mandel's Fitting Test can be found in this
[paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/ay/c2ay26400e#!divAbstract).
Equation ($5$) is used.

Percent Residual Accuracy ($PRA$) can be found in this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039914018307549).
Equation ($6$) is used.

Two methods are proposed to categorise the dilution curves.

### Workflow 1 

Workflow 1 involves using $R$ and $PRA$ to categorise the dilution curves.

 * If $R < 0.8$, classify as poor linearity.  
 * If $R \ge{0.8}$, $PRA < 80$, classify as poor linearity.  
 * If $R \ge{0.8}$, $PRA \ge 80$, classify as good linearity.  

### Workflow 2

Workflow 1 involves using $R$, $PRA$ and Mandel's Fitting Test to categorise the dilution curves.

 * If $R < 0.8$, classify as poor linearity.
 * If $R \ge{0.8}$, $PRA < 80$ and fit quadratic model and use Mandel's Fitting Test to see it is better 
     + If not better, classify as poor linearity 
     + If better, check concavity of the quadratic model
         - If concavity is negative, classify as saturation
         - If concavity is positive, classify as limit of detection (LOD)
 * If $R \ge{0.8}$, $PRA \ge 80$, classify as good linearity

## Usage

We first create our data set.

```{r data set creation}
library(DCVtestkit)
# Data Creation
dilution_percent <- c(10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 60,
                      75, 80, 100, 125, 150,

dilution_annot <- tibble::tibble(Sample_Name = sample_name,
                                 Dilution_Batch = dilution_batch,
                                 Dilution_Percent = dilution_percent)
lipid_data <- tibble::tibble(Sample_Name = sample_name,
                             Lipid1 = lipid1_area_saturated,
                             Lipid2 = lipid2_area_linear,
                             Lipid3 = lipid3_area_lod,
                             Lipid4 = lipid4_area_nonlinear)
```

We merge the data together using `create_dilution_table` and summarise a dilution
curve for each transition and batch.

```{r example}
# Create dilution table and dilution statistical summary
dilution_summary <- create_dilution_table(dilution_annot, lipid_data,
                                          common_column = "Sample_Name",
                                          signal_var = "Area",
                                          column_group = "Transition_Name"
                                          ) %>% 
    summarise_dilution_table(grouping_variable = c("Transition_Name",
                                                   "Dilution_Batch"),
                             conc_var = "Dilution_Percent",
                             signal_var = "Area")

dilution_summary
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
